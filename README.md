This project demonstrates a **complete microservices-based architecture** built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, **Apache Kafka**, **Docker**, and **Keycloak**.  
It implements both **synchronous and asynchronous communication**, **distributed tracing**, **centralized configuration**, and **secure authentication** ‚Äî all within a production-grade setup.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of multiple microservices communicating over REST and Kafka:

- **Configuration Server** ‚Äì Centralized configuration management for all services.  
- **Discovery Server (Eureka)** ‚Äì Service registry and discovery.  
- **API Gateway** ‚Äì Entry point to all backend services; routes and secures API traffic.  
- **Customer Service** ‚Äì Handles user data and customer-related operations.  
- **Product Service** ‚Äì Manages product information and database persistence.  
- **Order Service** ‚Äì Processes customer orders, communicates with Product and Payment services.  
- **Payment Service** ‚Äì Handles payment validation and completion of transactions.  
- **Notification Service** ‚Äì Sends asynchronous notifications upon successful order placement.

##  Core Features Implemented

###  Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Applied **DDD principles** to separate the domain logic, infrastructure, and application layers.  
- Each microservice contains its own **bounded context**, ensuring modularity and scalability.

###  Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous communication** via **OpenFeign** and **RestTemplate** for inter-service REST calls.  
- **Asynchronous communication** using **Apache Kafka** for order confirmations and notifications.  

###  Security
- Integrated **Keycloak** for identity and access management.  
- Configured **OAuth2 & JWT-based authentication** for securing APIs via the API Gateway.  

###  Containerization
- All services are containerized using **Docker**.  
- **Docker Compose** orchestrates the complete infrastructure:
  - Zookeeper & Kafka  
  - Postgres Databases  
  - Zipkin for tracing  
  - Keycloak for security  

###  Distributed Tracing & Monitoring
- Integrated **Zipkin** for distributed tracing of requests across microservices.  
- Exposed **Spring Actuator** metrics for system monitoring.

###  Exception Handling & Validation
- Global error handling using `@ControllerAdvice`.  
- Custom exceptions for validation, business logic, and runtime issues.
